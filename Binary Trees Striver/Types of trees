Types:
1) Full Binary tree: 
    * Each node has either 0 or 2 children.

2) Complete Binary tree: 
    * All levels are completely filled except the last one.
    * All nodes in the last level have nodes from leftwards without any empty spaces.

3) Perfect Binary tree:
    * All leaf nodes are at the same level.

4) Balanced Binary tree:
    * Height of tree is at max log(N). (N -> no. of nodes)

5) Degenerate Binary Tree:
    * Tree is the form of a single line downwards (either left or right).
