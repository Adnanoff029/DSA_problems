It is represented as a user derfined data type (let's say Node):

Members: 1) data (type: int)
         2) Left (type: Node || NULL)
         3) Right (type: Node || NULL)

Could be coded as: 
    struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node* left;
        struct Node* right;
        Node(int v)
        {
            data = v;
            left = right = NULL;
        }
    }
Note: We can also create a class for a particular node.

Initialized as:     
    struct Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
